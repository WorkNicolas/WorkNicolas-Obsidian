## Expressions VS Equations
### Expressions
- Math statement without an equal sign `(=)`
- Can only evaluate, manipulate
- Cannot solve (i.e. give a truth statement)

**Example**
$x+2$

$x^2$

$2y-1$
### Equations
- Math statement with an equal sign `(=)`
- Can solve
- Can evaluate the truth of a statement

**Example**
$x+2=5$
$x=5-2$
$x=3$

$x^2=16$
$x=4, -4$
$(4)^2=16(-4)^2=16$

$2y-1=5$
$2y=5+1$
$2y=6$
$\frac{2y}{2}=\frac{6}{2}$
$y=3$

### Difference Between Expressions and Equations
- The answer to the *equation* is called a *solution*
- Equations can be solved while expressions cannot be solved
- If the largest exponent of the equation is 1, then there will only be one solution to the equation.
	- If the largest exponent of the equation is 2, then there will be two solutions to the equation.
	- This applies to $x^n$ exponents.
