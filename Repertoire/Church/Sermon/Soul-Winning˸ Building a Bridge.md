## Theme
- Soul-Winning

## Message
- The greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart and all your soul
- The second greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as you love yourself
- A cult does things out of the will of God
- Soul-winning is a part of God
- Jesus came not to be served, but to serve and save those who are lost
- To win a soul is wise
- A sign that a church is alive is that it is soul-winning
- Like Enoch, we will not experience physical death on the second coming of Jesus
- You cannot be a disciple of Jesus if you do not disregard your own family
- Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household
- When Jesus saw multitudes of people who are sickly and diseased, He was moved with compassion
    - The secret to soul-winning is compassion
- The Gospel is not just for Jews, but for everyone
- God's calling is irrevocable
- Do not share the gospel if you do not have love for others for it is just noise
- Without love for others, generosity does not profit oneself
- Blessed are those who have been persecuted in God's namesake
- Jesus told a parable to a lawyer named Nicodemus about "The Good Samaritan"
- *The Good Samaritan:* A man going from Jerusalem to Jericho is attacked by robbers who strip him and beat him. A priest and a Levite pass by without helping him. But a Samaritan stops and cares for him, taking him to an inn where the Samaritan pays for his care.
- Compassion is a bridge; We create bridge to reach out to people
