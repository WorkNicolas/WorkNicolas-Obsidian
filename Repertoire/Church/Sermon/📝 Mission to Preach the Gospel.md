## Reflection
> [!Bible] [2 Timothy 4:1-8 - WEB](https://bible-api.com/2Timothy+4:1-8?translation=web)
> <sup> **1** </sup>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
> <sup> **2** </sup>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.
> <sup> **3** </sup>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
> <sup> **4** </sup>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.
> <sup> **5** </sup>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
> <sup> **6** </sup>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
> <sup> **7** </sup>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
> <sup> **8** </sup>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
