## Using a Subquery to Solve a Problem

## Subquery Syntax

```jsx
SELECT select_list
FROM table
WHERE expr_operator

	(SELECT select_list
	FROM table);
```

```sql
SELECT last_name salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary >
	(SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE last_name = 'Abel');
```

## Types of Subqueries

**Note:**Â There are also multiple-column subqueries, which are queries that return more than one column from the inner SELECT statement.

### Single-Row Subquery

Queries that return only one row from the inner SELECT statement

### Multiple-Row Subquery

Queries that return more than one row from the inner SELECT statement

## Executing Single-Row Subqueries

```sql
SELECT last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE job_id = 
	(SELECT job_id
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id = 141)
AND salary >
	(SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id = 143);
```

## Using Group Functions in a Subquery

```sql
SELECT last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary =
	(SELECT MIN(salary)
	FROM employees);
```

```sql
SELECT department_id, MIN(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING MIN(salary) >
	(SELECT MIN(salary)
	FROM employees
	WHERE department_id = 50);
```

## Incorrect Subquery Syntax

```sql
SELECT employee_id, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary =
	(SELECT MIN(salary)
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id)

```

```sql
ERROR at line 4:
ORA-01427: single-row subquery returns more than one row
```

***Note:*** The `WHERE` clause only accepts one value thus, group rows are invalid

## Return No Rows

```sql
SELECT last_name, job-id
FROM employees
WHERE job_id =
	(SELECT job_id
	FROM employees
	WHERE last_name = 'Haas'
```

Subquery returns no values since there is no employee named Haas.

There is no `job_id = NULL` thus, returns no rows.

## Multiple-Row Subqueries

| Operator | Definition                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| IN       | Equal to any member in the list                      |
| ANY      | Compare value to each value returned by the subquery |
| ALL      | Compare value to every value returned by the subquery                                                     |

### IN Operator

```sql
SELECT last_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary IN
	(SELECT MIN(salary)
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id);
```

```sql
SELECT last_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary IN (2500,4200,4400,6000,7000,8300,8600,17000);
```

### ANY Operator

```sql
SELECT employee_id, last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < ANY
	(SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG')
AND job_id <> 'IT_PROG';
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
`< ANY`: less than the maximum

`> ANY:` more than the maximum
=======
************`< ANY`:** less than the maximum

`> ******ANY`:** more than the maximum
>>>>>>> origin/main

************`= ANY`:** equivalent to IN

### ALL Operator

```sql
SELECT employee_id, last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < ALL
	(SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG')
AND job_id <> 'IT_PROG';
```

`> ALL` more than the maximum

`< ALL` less than the minimum

`NOT` can be used with `IN`, `ANY`, and `ALL` operators

### NULL Values

Does not return any rows due to the existence of a single NULL value

```sql
SELECT emp.last_name
FROM employees emp
WHERE emp.employee_id NOT IN
	(SELECT mgr.manager_id
	FROM employees mgr);
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Display Employees who have subordinates**

```sql

```

>>>>>>> origin/main

```sql
SELECT last_name FROM employees
WHERE employee_id NOT IN
	(SELECT manager_id
	FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL);
```

## GROUP BY and HAVING

```sql
SELECT department_id, MIN(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING MIN(salary) < ANY
	(SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE department_id IN (10,20))
ORDER BY department_id;
```

Return the salaries of employees in departments 10 and 20.

MIN is used to group the outer query by department_id

## Multiple-Column Subqueries

```sql
SELECT employee_id, manager_id, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE (manager_id, department_id) IN
	(SELECT manager_id, department_id
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id IN (149,174))
AND employee_id NOT IN (149,174)
```

List the employees whose manager and departments are the same as the manager and department of employees 149 or 174.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, manager_id, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IN
	(SELECT manager_id
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id IN (149,174))
AND department_id IN
	(SELECT department_id
	FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id IN (149,174))
AND employee_id NOT IN (149,174);
```

-   Non-pair wise multiple-column subquery
-   Uses more than one column
-   Compares one at a time

## EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
