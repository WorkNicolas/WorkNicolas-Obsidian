## Functions and Limits
**Variables**
A quantity whose value may change during a given discussion or problem.

Example: $s$, $t$, $u$, $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, $z$

**Constant**
A quantity whose value are fixed during a given discussion or problem.
- Numerical Constants
- Absolute Constants

Example: $1$, $2$, $3$, $\frac{1}{2}$, ${R}$, ${\pi}$

**Arbitrary Constant**
Letters that has a fixed value during a given discussion or problem.

Example: $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$
$y=mx+b$
$y=3x+2$

Notes:
- $m$ and $b$ are arbitrary constants
- $m=3$ and $b=2$ are fixed values
## Relations and Functions
**Relation**
Any set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers.

**Function**
A relation for which each value from the set of the first components of the ordered pairs is associated with exactly one value from the set of second components of the ordered pairs denoted as $y=f(x)$.

An equation for which and $x$ that can be plugged into the equation will yield exactly one $y$ out of the equation.
