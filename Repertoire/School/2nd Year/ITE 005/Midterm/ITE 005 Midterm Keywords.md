| **Process Synchronization**     | Process synchronization coordinates processes in a multi-process system to prevent conflicts and ensure appropriate sequencing. It's essential to avoid issues like race conditions and deadlocks that arise when multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously. |
| **Cooperating Process**         | A concept in operating systems where two or more processes work together and share resources to accomplish a common goal. These processes communicate and synchronize with each other to achieve their objectives.                                                           |
| **Race Condition**              | A situation in a concurrent system where two or more processes compete for shared resources or try to modify shared data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable and erroneous behavior, and the outcome depends on the timing of each process.                     |
| **Critical-Section Problem**    | Cooperating Process is a concept in operating systems where two or more processes work together, communicate, and synchronize with each other to achieve a common goal by sharing resources.                                                                                 |
| **Mutual Exclusion**            | Mutual Exclusion is a synchronization mechanism in concurrent systems that allows only one process at a time to access shared resources, preventing synchronization problems that arise when multiple processes try to access shared data simultaneously.                    |
| **Progress**                    | Progress is a term in concurrent computing that describes a process's ability to execute and make progress towards completing its tasks, ensuring that each process has a fair opportunity to execute towards the desired outcome.                                           |
| **Bounded-Waiting**             | Bounded waiting is a concurrent computing concept where a process will acquire a resource it needs if other processes don't continually get the resource, with a guaranteed maximum waiting time.                                                                            |
| **Memory Barrier**              | A Memory Barrier is a hardware mechanism that ensures the ordering and consistency of memory operations in a parallel processing system by synchronizing memory operations between processors.                                                                               |
| **Memory Model**                | A Memory Model is a set of rules for memory operations in a concurrent system. It defines how threads access shared memory and ensures data consistency.                                                                                                                     |
| **Atomic Variable**             | Atomic variables are used in concurrent computing to prevent race conditions and ensure synchronization among threads or processes by performing operations as a single unit.                                                                                                |
| **Mutex Lock**                  | Mutex locks are a synchronization mechanism in concurrent computing that ensures only one thread or process can access a shared resource at a time by providing mutual exclusion.                                                                                            |
| **Semaphore**                   | A semaphore is a synchronization mechanism in concurrent computing that controls access to a shared resource using a counter that is incremented or decremented by threads or processes.                                                                                     |
| **Monitor**                     | Monitors are a synchronization construct in concurrent computing that coordinates access to a shared resource by providing mutual exclusion and condition variables for threads or processes to wait for certain conditions.                                                 |
| **Liveness**                    | Liveness is a property of a concurrent system that guarantees every process or thread will eventually make progress towards its goal.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Deadlock**                    | Deadlock is a state in a concurrent system where two or more processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a permanent impasse.                                                                                                       |
| **Starvation**                  | Starvation is a condition in a concurrent system where a process or thread is unable to access a resource it needs to proceed because other processes or threads are continuously accessing the resource.                                                                    |
| **Aging**                       | Aging is a technique used in scheduling algorithms to prevent starvation of low-priority processes by gradually increasing their priority so they eventually become eligible to execute.                                                                                     |
| **Priority Inversion**          | Priority inversion is a situation in a concurrent system where a lower-priority process holds a resource needed by a higher-priority process, causing the higher-priority process to wait and leading to degraded system performance.                                        |
| **Readers-Writers Problem**     | The Readers-Writers Problem is a synchronization problem in concurrent computing where multiple threads access a shared resource and the goal is to synchronize access to prevent race conditions or inconsistencies.                                                        |
| **Dining-Philosophers Problem** | The Dining-Philosophers Problem is a synchronization problem in concurrent computing where philosophers alternate between thinking and eating and the goal is to synchronize their behavior to prevent conflicts and starvation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
