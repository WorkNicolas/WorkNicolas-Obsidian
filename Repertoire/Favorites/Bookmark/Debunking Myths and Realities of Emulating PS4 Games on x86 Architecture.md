Text: In a technical discussion about the potential for emulating PS4 games on x86 architecture, users engage in a debate surrounding the challenges and possibilities of such emulation. One user points out that the PS4 uses x86_64 architecture, making traditional emulation unnecessary. They argue that compatibility layer-based solutions might not be as problematic as some believe, given the PS4's use of FreeBSD and OpenGL. Another user addresses the performance issues in "Bloodborne" on PS5, suggesting that it's more about the game's complex development history than poor optimization. They draw parallels to successful emulation efforts on the Xbox platform. Additionally, there is a clarification that "Dark Souls 3" doesn't run on the same engine as "Bloodborne," and the discussion delves into the potential for a sequel or remaster. The conversation highlights the technical intricacies of emulating games on different architectures and platforms.
