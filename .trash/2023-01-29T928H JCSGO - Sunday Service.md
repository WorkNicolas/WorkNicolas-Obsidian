- Jesus Christ has triumphed to save Man
- As long as we agree with God, as long as we are united, we will be victorious. As long as we live, life will always be triumphant

- As a child of God you are valuable
- The Bible declares that we have already been given the victory
- The more you consume the Word of God the more your faith strengthens
- People who seek God will become triumphant
