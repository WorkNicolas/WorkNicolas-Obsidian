## Expressions VS Equations
### Expressions
- Math statement without an equal sign `(=)`
- Can only evaluate, manipulate
- Cannot solve (i.e. give a truth statement)

**Example**
$x+2$

$x^2$

$2y-1$
### Equations
- Math statement with an equal sign `(=)`
- Can solve
- Can evaluate the truth of a statement

**Example**
$x+2=5$
$x=5-2$
$x=3$

$x^2=16$
$x=4, -4$
$(4)^2=16(-4)^2=16$

$2y-1=5$
$2y=5+1$
$2y=6$
$\frac{2y}{2}=\frac{6}{2}$
$y=3$

$\frac{1}{2} = -\frac{3}{4} + z$
$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} + z$
$\frac{2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4}  = z$
$\frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = z$
$\frac{5}{4} = z$

> [!note]
> The final answer should be in simplified form.
> - $\frac{5}{4}$ is a valid answer as it is already simplified
> - $1\frac{1}{4}$ is a mixed number form of $\frac{5}{4}$ but is not considered to be the simplified answer
> 	- However, it is also valid as long as the improper fraction is already simplified
> 	- Both mixed fraction and improper fraction form are valid answers

### Difference Between Expressions and Equations
- The answer to the *equation* is called a *solution*
- Equations can be solved while expressions cannot be solved
- If the largest exponent of the equation is 1, then there will only be one solution to the equation.
	- If the largest exponent of the equation is 2, then there will be two solutions to the equation.
	- This applies to $x^n$ exponents.
