## Propositions
- Theory
- Hypothesis
- Thesis
- Argument
- Premise
- Principle
- Theorem
- Concept
- Idea
- Statement

### Examples of Propositions
1. $2+5=9$
2. $5$ is a prime number.
3. $3$ is a prime number, but $6$ is not.
4. Every natural number can be written as the sum of the squares of three natural numbers.
5. He is over 5 ft tall.
6. $7 + 8 = 15$
7. Napoleon Bonaparte was the president of the United States.
8. The number $3$ is positive and the number $2$ is negative.
9. $\sqrt{3}$ is an integer.
### Not Propositions
1. Your property or mine?
2. What is the reason?
3. Go directly to him
4. Certainly, why not?
5. Do you speak Tagalog?
6. $a-x=5$
7. $a-b=b-a$

## Three Laws of Aristotelian Logic
| **Law**                  | **Elaboration**                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Law of Identity          | A thing is itself                                |
| Law of excluded middle   | A statement is either true or false but not both |
| Law of Non-Contradiction | No statement is both true or false               |

### Proposition Identification
**Sentence**
1. $3>1$
2. $-8←5←2
3. $\{1,2,3\} \cap \{3,4\}=\{3\}$
4. $3-5 \div 2$
5. $x+y=z$
6. $A \subset B$

**Identification**
1. Proposition: True
2. Proposition: True
3. Proposition: True
4. Not Proposition: N/A
5. Not Proposition: N/A
6. Not Proposition: N/A
