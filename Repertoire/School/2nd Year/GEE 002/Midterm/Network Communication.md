## Introduction
**What is networking?**
- increases the computer’s utility
- share printers, extra storage, exchange data, email

**What is the internet?**
- powerful computational resource
- powerful communication medium

## How Email Works
- What is **Email**?
	- messages embedded in files transferred between computers
- What is **Email Address**?
	- uniquely identifies cyberspace mailbox

> Using people as a means for an end
> 
> Receiving ads via cell phone costs money

**Act Utilitarian Evaluation**
> 1 from 100,000 will buy

>no way to accomodate millions of people
>
>many will think to drop their accounts

#### Social Contract Theory Evaluation
>your right to free speech does not mean that all will listen
>
>spammers are not introducing themselves

**Conclusion:** From all these perspectives, it is wrong to send spam

## Fighting Spam: Real-Time Blackhole List
**Trend Micro**
- contacts marketers who violate standards for bulk emails
- sells database of IP addresses that make spam to organizations
- unsecured mail servers that have been hijacked may be regarded as spammers and they will be blocked even if they are not spammers

## Ethical Evaluations of Publishing Blacklist
**Social Contract Theory Evaluation**
Senders and receivers do not derive equal benefit from emails.

**Utilitarian Evaluation**
Blacklisting will affect innocent users, receivers, and marketing firms this will reduce the benefits of internet utility as a whole.

Innocent users are used as a means for an end (eliminating spams).

## Proposed Solutions to Spam Epidemic
- Require an explicit opt-in of subscribers.
- Require labeling of email advertising (all commercial emails must write ADS on the subject line).
- Add a cost to every email that is sent for ads. A micropayment system is proposed.

## The Emergence of Spam
-   **Spam** is an unsolicited, bulk instant message
-   People combat spam by accepting messages only from friends or buddies

## Need for Socio-Technical Solutions

### New technologies sometimes cause new social situations to emerge
**Calculators:** feminization of bookkeeping

**Telephones:** blurred work/home boundaries

**Spam is an example of this phenomenon**
- Email messages practically free
- Profits increase with the number of messages sent
- Strong motivation to send more messages

**Internet design allows unfair, one-way communications**
