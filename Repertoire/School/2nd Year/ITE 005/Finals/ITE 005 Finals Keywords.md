|  HDD Scheduling                                           |  HDD interfaces requires a host to specify which track and which head to use. Its goals include fairness, timeliness, and optimizations, such as bunching reads or writes that appear in sequences, as drives perform best with sequential I/O.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  Cyclic redundancy check                                  |  A method of error detection for digital signals which treats message strings as a single binary word M, and divide it by a key word k that is known to both transmitter and the receiver. The remainder r left after dividing M by k constitutes the “check word” for the given message. The transmitter sends both the message string M and the check word r, and the receiver can then check the data by repeating the calculation, dividing M by the key word k, and verifying that the remainder is r.                                                                                                                                        |
|  Error-correction code                                    |  Refers to RAID level 2 scheme for file mirrors. Memory systems use parity bits to detect certain errors. Each byte that does not match the mirrored file is considered damage as it will not match the parity bits. Error-correction schemes stores two or more extra bits and can reconstruct the data if a single bit is damaged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  Low-level formatting or physical formatting              |  Fills the disk with a special data structure for each sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
