## Protections for Software - Software Copyrights
Copyright protection began in **1964**

**What gets copyrighted?**
Expression of idea, not idea itself

e.g. Implementation of the Relational Database Management System, not the concept of it

**Object Program, not Source Program**
- Because source codes are secrets
- Companies deliver executable files
- Companies treat source code as a trade secret

## Violation of Software Copyrights
**Copying** a program to give or sell to someone else.

**Preloading** a program onto the hard disk of a computer being sold.

**Distributing** a program over the internet.

## Safe Software Development
**Reverse engineering** is legal

Companies must protect against unconscious copying

### Solution
Clean Room Software Development Strategy

Team 1 analyzes the competitor’s program and writes specifications

Team 2 uses specification to develop software

## Open-Source Software: Consequences of Proprietary Software

- Increasingly harsh measures being taken to enforce copyrights (infringe our liberties)
- This act was created in an era with difficult to make copies. This is not the case now.
- Copyrights are not serving their purpose of promoting progress
- They make authors wealthy
- It is wrong to allow someone to own a piece of intellectual property
- Cooperation is more important than copyright

## Open-Source Definition
**License Characteristics**
- No restrictions preventing others from selling or giving away software
- Source code included in the distribution
- No restrictions preventing others from modifying source code
- The same rights apply to everyone receiving redistributions of the software
- Nothing states that Open-Source software must be given for FREE

## Beneficial Consequences of Open-Source Software
- Gives everyone opportunity to improve programs
- New versions of a program appear more frequently
- Eliminates tension between obeying law and helping others
- Programs belong to the entire community

### Shifts focus from manufacturing to service
- Buying Open-Source Software with easy installation steps
- Providing great manuals
- Providing support aftersales

## Examples of Open-Source Software
- BIND
	- Gives DNS for the entire internet
- Apache
	- Runs half of the web servers
- Sendmail
	- Moving email via the internet
- Perl, Python, Ruby, TCL/TK, PHP, Zope
- GNU (General Public License) compilers for C/C++, Objective-C, Fortan, Java, and Ada

## Impact of Open-Source Software
- Linux putting pressure on companies selling proprietary versions of Unix
- Linux putting pressure on Microsoft and Apple desktops
- The cost for these operating systems go down

## Critique of the Open-Source Movement
- Without attracting a critical mass of developers, open-source software quality can be poor
- Without an owner, incompatible versions may arise
- Relatively weak graphical user interface
- Poor mechanism for stimulating innovation

## The Legitimacy of Intellectual Property Protection for Software
**Utilitarian Analysis**
- Software licenses typically prevent you from making copies of the software to sell or give away
- Software licenses are legal agreements

## Utilitarian Analysis
**Arguments Against Copying**
- Copying software reduces software purchases
- …leading to less income for software developers
- …leading to lower production of new software
- …leading to fewer benefits to society

**Each of these claims can be debated**
- Not all who get free copies can afford to buy software
- The open-source movement demonstrates many people are willing to donate their software-writing skills
- The hardware industry wants to stimulate the software industry
- Difficult to quantify how much society would be harmed if certain software packages are not released
