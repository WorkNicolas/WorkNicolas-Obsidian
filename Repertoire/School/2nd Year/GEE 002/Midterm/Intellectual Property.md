## Introduction
**Digital Music Storage + Internet Crisis**
Value of intellectual properties much greater than the value of media
- creating the first copy is costly
- duplicates cost almost nothing

**Illegal Copying is Pervasive**
- The internet allows copies to spread quickly and widely
- In light of information technology, how should we treat intellectual property?

## What is Intellectual Property?
**Intellectual Property**
Any unique product of the human intellect that has commercial value

**Examples**
- Books, songs, movies
- Paintings, drawings
- Inventions, chemical formulas, computer programs
- Intellectual Property (Idea) ≠ Physical Manifestation (Paper)

## Property Rights
**Locke: The Second Treatise of Government**
People have a right…
- to property in their own person
- to their own labor
- to things which they remove from nature through their labor

As long as…
- no person claims more property than he or she can use
- after someone removes something from the common state, there is plenty left over

## Analogy is Imperfect
If two people write the same play, both cannot own it $\frac{3}{4}$ of every intellectual property is one-of-a-kind.

If one person takes another’s playing, both have it $\frac{3}{4}$ copying an intellectual property is different from stealing a physical object.

## Benefits of Intellectual Property Protection
**Some people are altruistic; some are not**
People can benefit from having ownership of their ideas, and thus can improve the quality of live for others

**The allure of wealth can be an incentive for speculative work**
Giving creators right to their inventions stimulates creativiity

## Limits to Intellectual Property Protection
1. Society benefits most when inventions are in the public domain
2. Congress has struck a compromise by giving authors and inventors rights for a limited time
3. Authors of the US constitution recognized the benefits to limited intellectual property protection

## Protecting Intellectual Property
- Trade secrets
- Trademarks and service marks
- Patents
- Copyrights

### Trade Secret
- Confidential piece of intellectual property that gives the company a competitive advantage
- Employees are asked to make a confidentiality agreement
- Never expires
- Not appropriate for all intellectual properties (movies should not be kept a secret)
- Reverse engineering allowed
- Maybe compromised when employees leave the firm

**Examples**
- Formulas
- Customers’ list
- Strategic plans
- Proprietary design

### Trademark and Service Mark
**Trademark**
- identifies goods
- given by a government to a distinctive product
- byword, symbol picture, color, smell sound

**Servicemark**
- the company can establish a **brand name**
- does not expire
- if a brand name becomes a common noun, the trademark may be lost (Aspirin)
- companies advertise to protect their trademarks, using adjectives not verbs or nouns
- companies protect trademarks by contacting those who misuse them (photoshop must not be used as a verb or noun from misusers)

### Patent
- A public document that provides detailed description of the invention
- Provides owner with the exclusive right to the invention
- The owner can prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention for twenty years
- After that, anyone can make use of the idea

**Example**
Polaroid VS Kodak (Instant Photography)

### Copyright
**Provides owner of an original work five rights**
- Reproduction
- Distribution
- Public DIsplay
- Public performance
- Production of derivative works

**Example**
movie, music, software, book industry

## Fair Use Concept
**Legal to reproduce a copyrighted work without permission**
Citing short excerpts for teaching, research, criticism, commentary, and news reporting

**Courts consider four facts**
1. Purpose and character of the use
2. Education is permissible, not commercial
3. Nature of work
4. Fiction VS nonfiction and published preferred over non-published
