## Message
- The Church is compared to marriage
- Commitment to Jesus Christ
- You are saved through faith, not through good works
- If you love Jesus Christ, tend to His flock
- Routine does not amount to anything in faith, but your relationship with Jesus Christ
- A Christian is rendered as a true person of holiness
- Tend to your children even if one is busy with work
- While Mary was busy with work, Martha was tending to Jesus Christ; Tending to her relationship with the Lord (Luke 10:38-42)
- Several young prophets and servants of the Lord served Him while young (e.g. Prophet Samuel, Timothy, and King David)
- David seeks to serve in the house of the Lord all the days of his life

### Redemption
1. Jesus paid our sins with His blood (Acts 20:28)
2. We wait for the return of the Lord
