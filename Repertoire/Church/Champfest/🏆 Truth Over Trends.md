	- The biggest deception of the enemy is he will distort the truth by making lies appear as true
2. **Build your life upon the truth not trends**

#### Lies of the Enemy

	- Satan loves it when we trust ourselves and not the Lord. *(Proverbs 3:5-6)*
2. Maliit na kasalanan lang naman. Hindi naman big deal.
	- You cannot be free from sin if you treat sin lightly. *(Galatians 5:13)*
3. Follow your heart.
	- The Lord says the heart is deceitful. *(Jeremiah 17:9)*
4. Mahirap magbago kaya manatili ka nalang na ganyan.
	- Following Jesus is all about taking next steps. *(Romans 11:33)*
5. Your past defines you.
