==Erroneous== information in database

==Misinterpretation== of database information

==Malfunction== of embedded systems

- Inconvenience
- Bad business decisions
- Fatalities
?
Effects of Computer Errors

- A computer system may fail because wrong data was entered into it
- A computerized system may fail because people incorrectly interpret data they retrieve
?
Data-Entry or Data-Retrieval Errors

- Number of records is increasing
- More erroneous records → More false arrests
- Accuracy of crime records is more important than ever
?
Position of Privacy Advocates

- Assume data correctly fed into computerized system
- System may still fail if there is an error in its programming
?
Software and Billing Errors

Qwest **send incorrect bills** to cellphone customers ($600/minute)

**Spelling and grammar error checkers** increased errors (University documents)

BMW **on-board computer failure** (Thailand finance minister was trapped in his BMW)

Temporarily out-of control Boeing 777 (Malaysian plane over the Indian ocean-**autopilot error**)

Patriot Missiles (28 soldiers killed) — **insufficient precision in a floating-point variable** (system clock)

Ariane 5 ($500 million not insured) - **Integer overflow error**

Therac-25 (3 patients killed out of 6 patients) **SW error resulted in overdoses**

- Failure to record votes
- Overcounting votes
- Misrecording votes
?
Voting Irregularities

- Lack of paper trail audits
- Vulnerability to tampering
- Source code a trade secret, can’t be examined
- Possibility of widespread fraud through malicious programming
?
Issues with DRE Voting Machines

==Causal== Condition: Actions (or inaction) caused the harm

==Mental== Condition: Actions (or inactions) intended or willed

==Mental== Condition: Moral agent is careless, reckless, or negligent

- Experiments are too expensive or time-consuming
- Experiments are unethical
- Experiments are impossible
?
Reason for Simulations to Replace Physical Experiments

-   Model past events (evolution of the universe)
-   Understand the world (search for oil)
-   Predict the future (weather predictions)
?
Uses of Simulations

-   Bugs in software
-   Models used flawed software
?
Reasons for Erroneous Simulations

**Verification**: Does program correctly implement the model

**Validation**: Does the model accurately represent the real system?

-   Make prediction, wait to see if it comes true (car crash)
-   Predict the present from old data (weather forecast)
-   Test credibility with experts and decision makers
?
Validation Methods

**Specs**: Determine the functions to be performed

**Development**: Produce software that meet specs

**Validation**: Testing the software

**Evolution**: Modify the software to meet requirements

-   Determine system requirements
-   Understand constraints
-   Determine feasibility (budget and schedule)
?
SE Specs

-   High-level statement of requirements (summary)
-   Mock-up of user interface
-   Low-level requirements statement (detailed)
?
End products

1.  Create high-level design
2. Discover and resolve mistakes, omissions in specification
3. Case tools to support design process
4. Object-oriented systems have advantages
5. After detailed design, actual programs written
6. Result: working software system
?
Development

Ensure software satisfies ==specs==

Ensure software meets ==user’s needs==

- Noncontinuous responses to changes in input. No identical set of inputs
- Exhaustive testing impossible. Infinite number of different inputs
- Testing reveals bugs, but cannot prove none exist
?
Challenges to testing software

- Accept software “as-is”
- 90-day replacement or money-back guarantee
- None accept liability for harm caused by software
?
Shrink-Wrap Warranties

- Companies would test software more
- Purchase liability insurance
- Software would cost more
- Start-ups would be more affected more than big companies
- Less innovations in software industry
?
Harmful Consequences of Defects

Making vendors responsible for harmful consequences of defects may be ==wrong==

Consumers should not have to ==pay for bug fixes==
