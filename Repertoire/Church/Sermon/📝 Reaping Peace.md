## Theme
- Peace
- Inner Peace

## Message
- Peace is not the absence of chaos, but inner peace of the heart during tribulations
- Christian life is a race, as Paul said, "I have finished the race..."
- Tribulations can be overcome through inner peace that comes from God as inner peace cannot be found on Earth, and neither from the devil
- Heaven is our true inheritance, land given to us on Earth
- Oppressive spirit, the opposite of peace, gives way to ravenous rage
- Be careful of nothing for it causes chaos in the mind
- The source of inner peace is no other than Jesus Christ
- To find wisdom, fear the Lord, which will lead to the path of peace

--Isaiah 9:6
