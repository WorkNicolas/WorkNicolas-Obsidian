| Controller                    | A controller is a collection of electronics that can operate a port, a bus, or a device.                                                                                    |

| Interrupt Handler             | Determines the cause of the interrupt, performs the necessary processing and executes a return from the interrupt to the execution state prior to the interrupt.            |
| Maskable Interrupts           | Reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors.                                                                                                                    |
