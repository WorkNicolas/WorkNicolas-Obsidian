### Main Verse
> [!Bible] [Hebrews 12:14-17 - WEB](https://bible-api.com/Hebrews+12:14-17?translation=web)
> <sup> **14** </sup>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,
> <sup> **15** </sup>looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
> <sup> **16** </sup>lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.
> <sup> **17** </sup>For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.
