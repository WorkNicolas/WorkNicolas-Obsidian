| **Process Synchronization**     | Process synchronization coordinates processes in a multi-process system to prevent conflicts and ensure appropriate sequencing. It's essential to avoid issues like race conditions and deadlocks that arise when multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously. |
| **Cooperating Process**         | A concept in operating systems where two or more processes work together and share resources to accomplish a common goal. These processes communicate and synchronize with each other to achieve their objectives.                                                           |
| **Race Condition**              | A situation in a concurrent system where two or more processes compete for shared resources or try to modify shared data at the same time. This can lead to unpredictable and erroneous behavior, and the outcome depends on the timing of each process.                     |
| **Critical-Section Problem**    | Cooperating Process is a concept in operating systems where two or more processes work together, communicate, and synchronize with each other to achieve a common goal by sharing resources.                                                                                 |
| **Mutual Exclusion**            | Mutual Exclusion is a synchronization mechanism in concurrent systems that allows only one process at a time to access shared resources, preventing synchronization problems that arise when multiple processes try to access shared data simultaneously.                    |
| **Progress**                    | Progress is a term in concurrent computing that describes a process's ability to execute and make progress towards completing its tasks, ensuring that each process has a fair opportunity to execute towards the desired outcome.                                           |
| **Bounded-Waiting**             | Bounded waiting is a concurrent computing concept where a process will acquire a resource it needs if other processes don't continually get the resource, with a guaranteed maximum waiting time.                                                                            |

| **Liveness**                    | Liveness is a property of a concurrent system that guarantees every process or thread will eventually make progress towards its goal.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Deadlock**                    | Deadlock is a state in a concurrent system where two or more processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a permanent impasse.                                                                                                       |
| **Starvation**                  | Starvation is a condition in a concurrent system where a process or thread is unable to access a resource it needs to proceed because other processes or threads are continuously accessing the resource.                                                                    |
| **Aging**                       | Aging is a technique used in scheduling algorithms to prevent starvation of low-priority processes by gradually increasing their priority so they eventually become eligible to execute.                                                                                     |
| **Priority Inversion**          | Priority inversion is a situation in a concurrent system where a lower-priority process holds a resource needed by a higher-priority process, causing the higher-priority process to wait and leading to degraded system performance.                                        |
| **Readers-Writers Problem**     | The Readers-Writers Problem is a synchronization problem in concurrent computing where multiple threads access a shared resource and the goal is to synchronize access to prevent race conditions or inconsistencies.                                                        |

| **Frames**                       | Fixed-sized blocks of physical memory.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Page Table**                   | In paged memory, a table containing the base address of each frame of physical memory, indexed by the logical page number.                                                                                |
| **Page Number**                  | Part of a memory address generated by the CPU in a system using paged memory.; an index into the page table.                                                                                              |
| **Page Offset**                  | Part of a memory address generated by the CPU in a system using paged memory; the offset of the location within the page of the word being addressed.                                                     |
| **Swapping**                     | Moving a process between main memory and a backing store. A process may be swapped out to free main memory temporarily and then swapped back in to continue execution.                                    |
| **Roll Out, Roll In**            | Storing a computer program or program segment onto the disk and another bringing another program into that memory space.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Page Fault**                   | A fault resulting from a reference to a non-memory-resident page of a memory.                                                                                                                             |
| **Pure Demand Paging**           | A demand paging scheme wherein no page is brought into memory until it is referenced.                                                                                                                     |
| **Frame-Allocation Algorithm**   | The operating-system algorithm for allocating frames among all demands for frames.                                                                                                                        |
| **Page-Replacement Algorithm**   | In memory management, the algorithm that chooses the victim frame of physical memory will be replaced by a needed new frame of data.                                                                      |
| **Belady’s Anomaly**             | An anomaly in frame-allocation algorithms in which a page-fault rate may increase as the number of allocated frames increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
